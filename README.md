# PUMA Shoes Website
This website is to let people be able to buy just shoes from PUMA. It allows customers to purchase and scroll PUMA shoes. PUMA's website has a lot more variety while this website only consists of shoes to let customers who want to buy shoes can help minimize the trouble of filtering out to display only shoes. This website mainly eases customers from searching or filtering out things they do not want to see. If a user who is a shoe enthusist, he or she can purchase the shoe easily from this website. Other than selling solely on shoes, users are able to scroll for shoes and collaborations would be placed at the home page to notify customers of the new collaboration. 

PUMA is a famous branded company that sells shoes, socks, shirts and pants. However, as many buyers love to have their website customise to their choice, my webste design is able to fit their requirements and that you are able to shop your shoes items easily from the website. This website show PUMA collaboration shoes.

## Design Process
The reason why i wanted to design a webpage of PUMA shoes is so that shoe enthusist and customers who wants to only scroll for shoes they do not need to filter out or go around the website to find where they cab scroll for shoes and to find for new collaborations puma have. My webpage let customers know about the latest collaboration and to let user scroll by different category like women, men and kids collection so that they do not need to filter out to find kids shoes
- As a user i would want to see the latest collaboration that PUMA so that i could buy them to sell or to keep
- As a user i would want to scroll just a particular category of shoes so that i could find kids shoes or females shoes to scroll and see
- As a user i would want find contact information so that i can contact them when i have any quries 
- As a user i would want to know the physical stores so that i could go to the stores to try on the shoes
- As a user i would want to know the physical store type so that i know which is the outlet store so to know where has the most shoe range and stock available
